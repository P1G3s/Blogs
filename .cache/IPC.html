<h3 id="pipe">Pipe</h3>
<p><strong>Pipe</strong> is created by pipe() with two <strong>file descriptor</strong> representing <strong>two sides of pipe - input(1) and output(0)</strong>, To make pipe works like &quot;|&quot; in shell, following steps shall be taken (child | parent) (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37508/in-what-order-do-piped-commands-run">by the way pipe run concurrently</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>fork()</li>
<li>change <strong>stdout</strong> to <strong>pipe input</strong> in child proccess</li>
<li>exec child  program</li>
<li>change <strong>stdin</strong> to <strong>pipe output</strong> in parent proccess</li>
<li>exec parent program</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fifo">FIFO</h3>
<p><strong>FIFO</strong> is a file that can be raed or write by proccesses, <strong>so fork() is no longer needed</strong> as long as proccesses can access this file(FIFO)</p>
<ul>
<li>open blocked until another proccess open</li>
<li>read blocked until another proccess finished writting?</li>
<li>write blocked until another proccess finishes reading?</li>
</ul>
